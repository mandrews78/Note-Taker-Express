# Note Taker

In this assignment we were to modify the starter code we were given to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write, saved, and delete notes.  This application uses an Express.js backend and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The user can enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
When you click on the Save icon, the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
When you click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column.
